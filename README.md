This repository contain the course project of Getting and Cleaning data. There are 3 other  files in this repo which are :
  
  * `codeBook.md` which contain all the information about the variable and the steps in getting and cleaning data.
  * `run_analysis.r` contain the script which perform all the steps to read the data from the source files and manipulate it and generate a tidy data set.
  * `tidyData.txt` contain the independent tidy data set.
  
# Steps to run the script
  
  * First you have to download the dataset for processing from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
  * You can also find the details about this dataset from [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
  * You have to unzip the files in your working directory.
  * After that you will have to download the script file from this repository and place it in your working directory.
  * Than you have to run the script in R or RStudio like that `run_analysis()`.
  * After the script is successfully processed , a message will appear and the file will be generated in your working directory.
